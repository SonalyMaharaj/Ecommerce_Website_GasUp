      <p class="nospace font-xs">Meet the team</p>
      <p class="heading underline font-x2">Allow us to intoduce Ourselves</p>
        <p class="nospace font-xs"> We are the only gas lifestyle destination company in Gauteng. And by gas lifestyle we mean uninterrupted! Uninterrupted by power failures, uninterrupted by frustrating billing nonsense, uninterrupted by incompetent officials that can't answer your queries. <b>Uninterrupted.</b> 
            <br />We get that your home is your castle, we get that service is breaking china, we get that getting on board with gas is a scary start, we get that compliance is complicated and messy and confusing, we get that showering at the gym sucks, we get that electricity is getting expensive, We get that cooking with gas is a basic human right, we get that technology solves problems, we get that you want to be held and cuddled after the sale is concluded, we get that angry customers are also without fail customers that aren't being heard;<b>We get you.</b>
            <br />We know a dirty little secret. Gas is the only viable, affordable and accessible alternative fuel source. And we want to shout it from roof tops at the top of our lungs.
            We're really friggin' old. We're been around since 1947. We were among the very first companies to start selling bottled gas when it originally got certified for sale in SA. We were founding members of the Gas Safety Association, the umbrella body that represents our industry. We've got installations in the field that are older than Justin Bieber's mom.</p>
